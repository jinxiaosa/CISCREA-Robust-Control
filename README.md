MOOS-IvP-Robust-Application
======================

The idea is to test a numerical modeling & robust Control combined manuvering method on CISCREA AUVs inside the framework of MOOS-IvP. Theory descriptions are located on Researchgate, Phd work of Rui YANG (ENSTA Brestagne & Ocean University of China).

This code is one of many user defined moos-ivp applications ontop of the moos-ivp helm. A heading and depth control are implemented respectively.
